# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Created health tracker app to help with the 100 days of health.

**Thoughts:** Decided on vue; used the PWA template in hopes that I can "install" this on my mobile device. Made decent progress with app skeleton.

### Day 2: April 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Updated some styling; added icons for switching between fitness and food

**Thoughts:** Concentrated too much on front end look instead of getting the functionality going. That is a common problem for me =]

### Day 3: April 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Added summary page; changed header to navigation; tied data together to different pages

**Thoughts:** Made a lot of progress on passing around data to different component with vue. Quite enjoyed it! App is nearly ready to be used on my phone.
